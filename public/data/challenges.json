    "description": "Thanks to next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, evolutionary biologists can now regularly tackle important questions like \u201cWhat are the genes involved in adaptation to climate?\u201d and \u201cWhat genomic factors prevent climate-sensitive species from adapting?\u201d<br><br>The bottleneck in our research is the computational work involved in processing huge amounts of raw DNA sequence data. VLSCI researchers have developed a pipeline, Rubra, built on the Ruffus Python library, that allows us to process and analyse genomic data on the powerful VLSCI computing cluster. However this pipeline needs improvement to make it more generally usable and flexible. Within our research group, this will make Rubra accessible to biologists with limited programming skills, and allow us to easily customise our workflow for each new experiment. This will take us closer to understanding the genomic basis for climate adaptation, which in turn will let us identify the types of species most in need of protection under climate change.",

I would like a model that shows the differences that differing underlying assumptions make. The ABS and AIHW both have different assumptions of under-identification in different age groups, they don\u2019t put errors around that but we could! We could look at a variety of models and see what we come up with, and if it is different from the official statistics. Something graphical that lets people get away from the life tables.",

    "summary": "Epilepsy is a disorder of brain functions that takes the form of recurring seizures. 3-4% of the Australian population will be diagnosed with epilepsy. There are a range of seizure types that people can experience, a variety of seizure triggers, a wide range of antiepileptic drugs and therapeutic doses, and over the course of a person\u2019s epilepsy story the impact of epilepsy on a their life will vary. Patient history information is usually stored in narrative text making longitudinal analysis difficult. The tool that we would like to developed will be used by clinicians to visualise patient data, and find correlations between seizure frequency, medication, severity of impact on life, and any potential surgery.",
