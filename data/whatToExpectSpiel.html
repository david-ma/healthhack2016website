<p>HealthHack is a weekend data hack dedicated to problems that medical researchers face. Scientists often create vast amounts of data, but donâ€™t always have good ways to analyse, visualise and communicate it. This weekend will bring together software developers, user experience designers, data analysts and visualisers working directly with researchers to create new, better tools.</p>
