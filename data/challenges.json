Currently, prevalence rates of scabies in Indigenous communities are established through screening events, or based on clinic presentation data. In screening events, a questionnaire developed from a sales app (DoForms) is used. In this, demographic information is preloaded onto the form, data is either typed or entered numerically during the screening, and the information is downloaded to an excel spreadsheet at the completion of the screening.
