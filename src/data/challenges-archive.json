Currently, prevalence rates of scabies in Indigenous communities are established through screening events, or based on clinic presentation data. In screening events, a questionnaire developed from a sales app (DoForms) is used. In this, demographic information is preloaded onto the form, data is either typed or entered numerically during the screening, and the information is downloaded to an excel spreadsheet at the completion of the screening.

As part of a bigger project to try and understand climate adaptation at the genomic level, we've taken advantage of recent advances in DNA sequencing technology to sequence the genomes of 23 Australian Drosophila species.\n\nWe and our interstate collaborators need to browse and search these genomes easily so we set up a local instance of the University of California (Santa Cruz)'s \u003ca href=\"https://genome.ucsc.edu/\"\u003eGenome Browser\u003c/a\u003e software.

It does something sufficiently complex that is hard to rewrite. In short, it's a problematic but important open-source software package. Uploading new data to display in the browser requires command-line skills that some researchers don't have, and so that this resource can continue to be used by everyone in the lab, we'd love some help creating a nice front end.\n\nWe are envisaging a data upload tool that guides the user through the process of installing either:\na) \u003cb\u003ea new reference genome from a different Drosophila species\u003c/b\u003e\n   The reference genome itself is a ~150MB text file in \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format\"\u003efasta format\u003c/a\u003e. \n   This step also requires some metadata input, either in two small text files or ideally to be entered through the GUI. \n   or\nb) \u003cb\u003e(optional) a genome annotation file to display on an existing reference genome.\u003c/b\u003e\n   This is a ~2MB text file in \u003ca href=\"https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1\"\u003eBED format\u003c/a\u003e, which contains information about the locations of genes, microRNAs, transcription factor binding sites or various other features of interest on the reference genome. \n\nThis tool will integrate with existing scripts that automate database creation and other steps in adding data to the genome browser, give feedback on success/failure, and display progress for the user. Some nice extras could include emailing an admin when new data is uploaded; validation, collection of feedback and stats; eye candy! \n\n\u003cb\u003eKey skills:\u003c/b\u003e (some combination of...)\n - linux sysadmin on command line (ubuntu 14.04.3)\n - bash\n - web technologies (html, css, js, php, python, UI, UX - we are agnostic re tools used to complete the job)\n - git\n ",

    "description": "Arthritis affects 3.85 million Australians (15 million in the UK, 50 million in the US!). It costs the Australian economy $24 billion each year. It is painful, debilitating and can lead to permanent disability.\n\nYet arthritis receives little media coverage and even less dollars. Despite annual growth in sufferers, government funding is minuscule and shrinking. Treatment is mainly limited to surgery and prescription medicine, although research shows more holistic approaches considerably reduce symptoms.\n\nArthritis is not a disease limited to ‘old people’. Over half the people with arthritis – almost two million – are of working age. The cost to the community is huge, and it’s one of the most common causes of work absenteeism. Arthritis sufferers are also 30% more likely to suffer from depression.\n\nDespite arthritis being a National Health Priority Area, and the huge, rising cost to the community, arthritis funding has declined. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) reports funding was at its highest between 2008 and 2010 with over $26 million and has dropped to $21 million and $23 million respectively in 2013/2014. While funding to most other National Health Priority Areas has increased, arthritis has seen the highest decline.\n\nThere is little awareness about how bad the situation is and very little support for arthritis sufferers on how to manage their condition. An ageing and increasingly overweight population only exacerbates the problem.\n\n\u003cb\u003eThe challenge\u003c/b\u003e\nAlthough there currently is no cure for arthritis, patients can improve significantly by taking their medications on a regular basis, following a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, regularly taking part in light to moderate exercise and taking anti-inflammatory supplements such as fish oil.\n\nManaging a complex treatment plan and the resulting lifestyle changes can be challenging if not impossible for patients. On the other hand, it's challenging for doctors to provide the capacity, time or skills to deliver a holistic approach and monitor all aspects of a patient's wellbeing.\n\nHere is where a technology solution could come in.\n\nCan you create an online tool (app?) that allows patients to monitor their condition on a daily basis, tracks symptoms such as pain levels, mobility, fatigue as well as diet, mood, weight, exercise, medications etc.? \n\nThe app would need to have motivational components (alerts, goals, community, videos) and should be easy to use (e.g. consider users with arthritis in their hands or users who are not very tech-savvy). Medication reminders and script reminders should be a part as well (direct connection with doctor/pharmacy?).\n\nUsers should be able to create data records they can share with their doctors \u0026 pharmacists - even better, doctors have a corresponding website, where they can see data records and monitor their patients! Patient data could be collected anonymously to create the world’s largest arthritis study? Doctors could even submit survey questions.\n\nThe app can also feed patients with healthy recipes, tips and tricks to manage their condition and individual challenges on a daily basis.\u003cbr/\u003eAny other ideas building on the above will be appreciated. (Online consultations with dietitians, doctors etc.? Wearable integration?)\n\nWhile not directly related to research, this is an opportunity to help millions of sufferers across the globe manage a complex and painful disease and provide relief. The challenge is to develop a tool that is easy to use and creates results which serve both patient and doctor at the same time.",

We would like to do it in real-time.\n\nThe sequential probability ratio test is a possibility. But what stopping rule to use? How to apply it to sequence alignment? Is there a way to test for significance? What about bayesian? What about deep learning?\n\nCan you come up with an efficient approach?",

A simple example of this kind of diagram is given in the figure. Since there are many situations in which patients may change treatment type at any point, the time points should be able to be specified when using the tool (e.g. looking at treatments in use at treatment start, day 50, day 100, etc, or at treatment start, day 10, day 20, etc.). It would also be useful to display the number of patients on each treatment type who have died or stopped treatment between each time point.

    "description": "In order to maintain high standards of care, it is necessary to compare the performance of health care providers, such as intensive care units, surgeons, or dialysis centres, to determine if there are any with unusually poor (or good) performance. Performance indicators for each provider are estimated, along with some measure of the variability of these performance indicators (such as the standard error of the estimated performance indicators). Funnel plots are often used to identify those providers with unusual performance. The funnel plot is essentially a scatter plot, with the performance indicator of each provider plotted on the y-axis, against the measure of variability on the x-axis. If a provider has usual performance, its performance indicator is expected to lie close to some “null” value. Standard formulas are used to compute statistical confidence intervals around this null value, within which performance indicators corresponding to usual performance are expected to lie. These confidence intervals form “funnels” around the null value, hence the title.\nI’d like a tool that constructs a funnel plot for a given set of performance indicators and can then be explored. For example, the ability to highlight the performance indicators of specific sub-groups of providers, such as those within particular states or territories of Australia, would allow patterns within the performance of providers to be explored.\n",

    "description": "While it is clear that children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) experience significant impairment in emotion recognition skills the most effective intervention modality to improve the emotion recognition skills of these children remains unclear. Children with ASD have demonstrated improvements in emotion recognition skills following computer based training. Computer based intervention provides a structured and predictable environment for learning, making them particularly suitable for children with ASD who often experience distress when confronted with unpredictability.  While adolescents with ASD may be internally motivated to engage in social communication and interaction, younger children with ASD are less socially motivated, and need more support in initiating and sustaining attention during emotion focused training. We aim to develop a prototype for what’s known as a “serious game platform” – games that educate and immerse users in realistic scenarios - to teach emotion recognition skills to children with high functioning Autism. In incorporating novel biofeedback measures to stimulate the behavioural and cognitive level of the player thereby guiding neuroplasticity to improve performance. The gaming platform will incorporate accessible and low cost electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracker (ET) devices which will allow the therapy to be delivered at the home environment. The EEG and ET devices and APIs will be provided at the HealthHack event. The chosen software development platform for game design is Unity, which provides key toolsets to realise the objectives of the serious game. A perfect team for this project should comprise of participants from the following domain areas; game design, programming, animators, human-computer interface, and psychology. ",

Depending on the number of individuals who experience a certain critical (or beneficial) event at the end of a stage, the trial is either stopped for futility or proceeds with the next stage (inclusion of further individuals and re-evaluation of pre-defined stopping criteria).

Given a certain minimum true event rate (i.e. toxicity between 0% and 100%) of a drug / \n       dose, how likely is it that the trial is stopped early (at a certain stage j)?\n   2. Given a certain maximum true event rate (i.e. toxicity between 0% and 100%) of a drug / \n       dose, how likely is it that the trial is successful (successfully passing all stages)?\n   3. Given the solution to question 1, what is the expected [as well as minimum and \n       maximum] number of patients that will be exposed to a potential harmful drug / dose \n       until the trial is stopped?\n   4. Given the solution to question 2, what is the expected [as well as minimum and \n       maximum] number of patients that will be exposed to a potential harmful drug / dose \n       for a successful trial?\n   5.

The only software feature required is the ability to sample random variables from a Binomial distribution and the ability to store and process matrices that contain all observed (within a simulation) outcomes. This allows, for example, the calculation of the proportion of early stops / no early trial stops among all simulation runs, given a certain parameter distribution.    \nThe key idea is that we can interpret relative frequencies (achieved via a large number of repeated simulations) as probabilities.

That’s us.\n \nOur clinical exam rostering system is crucial to co-ordinate the candidates and examiners in the correct location and to populate the marking sheets with demographics. Each group of about 16-20 candidates (called a rotation) needs about 30-35 examiners. We anticipate examining over 1,000 candidates in future. The State Faculty administration team use rotation roster templates to populate candidate and examiner information manually. Sounds simple but it has many complexities! One is that rotation rosters need to be finalized in a short period of time (over a few days).\n \nExaminers are stationary while candidates move from station to station (generally room to room). The clinical station criteria needs to match examiner demographics. As well as examiner gender, age, indigenous status, location and availability constraints, examiners may have conflict of interest with candidates or other examiners. Candidates may have conflict of interest with each other. Other complexities include:\n \n·         6 rotation roster templates available – not enough flexibility for faculties.\n·         One rotation roster template = 10 to 12 hours to create and test.\n·         One rotation roster = 16 to 20+ candidates = 30 to 35 examiners = 1+ hour of admin work.\n·         Stations vary in time: long case (2 per rotation), short case (12 per rotation) or rest (varies).\n·         Rotation rosters have various start times and locations.\n\nI imagine a world where we could input the constraints of the exam and output a first draft of every master timetable for every location with no clashes. Several staff could further tweak, check and finalize. When the rosters are final, we want to output (print) each individual roster for every person and every station. It would be great if the program could also tell us “You need X number of examiners with Y and Z attributes in locations ABC” so we can target/ recruit specific examiners.

    "summary": "A tool to identify and visualise differences in the cost of treating cancer patients",
    "description": "Cancer patients are all different. Some cases are more complex or more challenging to treat than others. As a result, the time and effort it takes to consult with patients and plan and deliver their care varies from one case to another.  For instance, it often takes fewer overall resources to successfully treat a young, early stage breast cancer patient than an older, frail patient with more advanced lung cancer.\n\nState-based funding for hospital services generally does not reflect the complexity of care; in a sense, treating every patient is considered to require the same amount of resourcing. Although the ebbs and flows of this approach may even out across a system, the impact in particular hospitals will vary. Some hospitals provide a greater volume of complex care than others; in these situations, the average funding value may be insufficient.\n\nOur current IT systems tend to focus on the information needed for safe clinical care and funding reporting obligations. This means gathering data to influence changes to funding approaches can be arduous (e.g. using paper-based collection processes). We figure there are much smarter ways of tackling this kind of challenge.\n\nCreate an app that will help us collect, analyse and visualise real-time information about each individual patient interaction with a cancer care team (doctors, nurses, allied health and admin professionals) so we can better understand and respond to patient variability.  Optimally, the solution would work in iOS, Android and Windows environments.  The app needs to span multiple settings and users and deal with situations where patients are present, as well as activity that occurs when patients are absent but is essential to proper care (e.g. planning for radiotherapy treatment).  Ideally, the app could identify patients using barcode recognition (attached to current medical records) and allow complete extraction so that information collected can be linked with data in other systems for holistic analysis.\n\nThe app is proposed to be deployed in four large Queensland hospitals.  The data captured will underpin advocacy for better funding allocations and assist local service planning. A key current objective is to make sure hospitals are funded fairly to treat the different groups of cancer patients they care for.  This will increase overall efficiency in the cancer system and encourage innovation and quality.  Ideally, the app could be ‘retrofitted’ to support similar processes in other clinical areas (e.g. diabetes care) as needed.\n",

On the other side, Australia’s research community has access to the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources project (NeCTaR) (http://nectar.org.au/) which provides an online infrastructure to collaborate, access and store data. This is a valuable resource but it needs to be exposed to scientists in a reachable fashion.\nAustralia’s researchers will be often pointed to the ‘Nectar’ research cloud or to a commercial cloud offering.

From that point of view, it is very important to understand the underlying relationship between the protein structure and its function and how this can be affected by changing the external conditions or binding o small molecules. The latter is especially important in drug design.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMolecular dynamics simulations can be considered as a “computational microscope” to study how atoms and molecules move in real time using physical models and supercomputers. In that process, the large data files (trajectories) are generated, which contain the information about position of each atom at time t and sometimes the velocities are included, too. MD simulations can be used to study various problems, from biological systems (proteins, nucleic acids, membranes) to materials (nanotubes, solid state matter). \n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, the biggest limitation of MD at the moment is accessing the relevant timescales at which proteins operate (microseconds to seconds), while at the moment the routinely available scales are hundreds of nanoseconds. To generate a trajectory for a very large system (~500 000 atoms) in duration of 200 ns would take weeks on a supercomputer (or GPU) or longer, depending on the hardware and software. That means that most of the MD simulations are computationally expensive and time consuming, which makes the resulting trajectories valuable assets in protein studies. However, in most of the cases the obtained trajectories are not made available to public for further use after the results have been published. That implies that each system of interest is repeatedly simulated every time when there is a need for it because the existing data is not available, which is not the most efficient way of using human and computational resources.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving a platform that would support sharing of the data generated:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eincreased transparency of publications relying on MD simulations;\n\u003cli\u003elong-term storage potential (this would be a very useful feature!);\n\u003cli\u003enew perspectives on old data: alternative analytical approaches and data mining possibilities;\n\u003cli\u003eavailability of ensembles of conformations instead of a single-structure representations given in PDB;\n\u003cli\u003eimproved structural models for ligand docking etc. \n\u003c/ul\u003e\nThe existence of this vast amount of data organised in one place would definitely lead towards better understanding of protein structure and function, which is crucial for understanding the origin of diseases on molecular level, cellular regulatory functions and specific drug design.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eTechnical challenges include:\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eChoice of database: storing, indexing and serving large binary files (typically \u003e 4GB).

The user interface should be designed to subscribe to a map and a path, and should visualise these live as the wheelchair moves through an environment. The user interface should enable a user to specify desired goals within the map, either by touching the map or by interacting with a virtual joystick control located at the bottom of the app window. The selected goal will be communicated to the ROS server through a published odometry topic.\n\nThe user interface will communicate with a laptop or other PC running Ubuntu and the ROS server.

    "description": "Social relationships can have a powerful effect on our health and wellbeing although their effects are typically complex: they can either heal or harm, (or they can do both or neither). For instance research has shown that adding one friend to your social network confers similar benefits to stopping smoking exceeding other well-established risk factors including obesity and physical inactivity.\nUsing this ‘social cure’ paradigm we have a developed novel social relationship mapping intervention we are currently piloting at a range of alcohol and other drug (AOD) rehabs across Australia which we’d like to develop into a tool for mobile devices.  \nOur current paper-based tool uses sticky notes, stickers and markers to enable people to map out their social group memberships and patterns of alcohol and drug use.  This visual method can simplify an often complex reality enabling people to better understand how their substance use impacts their social lives and vice versa.  \nWe are looking to develop a prototype of this tool, as an app for mobile devices or interactive website, focusing on intuitive interaction and useful data visualisation.\nWhile this tool is currently being used in an AOD setting, this intervention could be adapted to apply to any range of risky behaviours for use by clinicians and consumers alike.  \nWe are looking to collaborate with data visualisation experts and developers who like us are excited by this opportunity to create a novel open-source intervention that would allow people to visualise their social relationships and provide a platform to empower them to better understand their lives and improve their health and wellbeing.\n\u003ch4\u003eThe problem\u003c/h4\u003e\nAn interactive digital visual platform that allows people to audit, visualise and map their social relationships and substance use.\nWhile primarily this will be a tool to assist people to account for the way social and environmental contexts affect their lives (and in particular their AOD use), this tool could also provide a platform for data collection and help answer research questions about the link between social connectedness, problematic substance use and health and wellbeing.\nWe are a group of researchers in psychology, criminology, alcohol and drug studies and neuroscience working on a national research project about how social connectedness impacts recovery prospects among people with alcohol and drug problems. \nWe’d like to prototype a data visualisation methodology / platform to assist people to audit / visualise their social relationships and alcohol and other drug (AOD) use which could dovetail with our current work.  \nWhile this is an ambitious goal, at its heart this is a simple but potentially powerful idea and we are hopeful that this work will result in the development of an app for mobile devices and/or a website for use by clinicians and consumers alike. \nThe tool we have in mind would log the user’s:\n   - Social relationships and group membership\n   - Personal AOD use\n   - AOD use among social network\nThese data would be used to create a visual representation (a map) of the user’s social world with an overlay showing the location, intensity and type of AOD use (or other risky behaviours).\nIn short, we’re seeking to create a novel visualisation / mapping tool to allow app users to better account for and understand the complex relationship between their social lives and their AOD use, which could be used as an intervention to empower them to make more informed choices about their lives.\n\nWe eagerly look forward to the opportunity to pursue this new e-health and research platform.In particular, we are really excited by the prospect developing an open-source tool that would provide a platform for people to affect positive change in their lives and increase health and wellbeing while simultaneously leading to improvements in understanding about the link between social connectedness, problematic substance use and health and wellbeing.",

For now everything being open is a reasonable approach.\nThought needs to be given as to how tracings and annotations work beyond a 2D plane as is more typical in traditional web interfaces. A common approach it to treat a point as a sphere and show smaller circles in adjacent slices. Failing that a user will only be able to find annotations by chance when scrolling through the volume. User cues should feature heavily here but the mechanism for doing this requires a group of coders with some novel visual design ideas for web interfaces.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eStretch Goal\u003c/b\u003e\nCollaborative annotation across multiple instances of TissueStack. We have diverse groups of researchers working from multiple sites in Australia (and internationally). Ideally each volume should be traced by the combined knowledge and skill of multiple experts.

The Alliance’s vision is for Victoria to be a world leader in the use of clinical genomics in healthcare.\nBut to do this, we need to be smart about quality control (QC).   That’s what has inspired the concept of the IQ system, a database and analysis capability to allow efficient quality control for genomic testing.  We want to build an intelligent system that can use all the patient genomic data accumulating in Victoria to greatly improve genomic testing and boost performance and efficiency.\nWe believe there is an untapped potential for building a quality control system that is integrated with our existing genomics analysis capabilities (pipeline) and variant curation capability (database) – an Integrated Quality control system (IQ system).   This will allow the pipeline and database to continually learn to discriminate between good and bad quality. Sometimes this will help us discover unusual patterns in the data that turn out to be important to a patient.  \nSecondary data that is output from our pipeline are currently stored in flat files rather than in a database structure to allow analysis of trends and summaries of historical performance.  The long term vision of the IQ system is that it will (i) improve clinical interpretation of patient genomic variant data, (ii) meet quality control needs for monitoring the pipeline, (iii) evaluate pipeline updates and (iv) help establish quality assurance programs for genomic testing.  Melbourne \nGenomics will provide anonymised pipeline data generated from genomic testing of 300 patients for HealthHack 2015, and we hope this will ensure that the foundations of an IQ system can be designed and built (beginning with items i and ii). \nThe complexity and sheer volume of the data means that the IQ system needs to be fast and sophisticated.

    "summary": "Improving the use of antimicrobials is a critical element in the national and international strategies to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Australia has one of the best programs for collation and analysis of antimicrobial usage data from 73 hospitals across the nation. Currently antimicrobial usage data is submitted bi-monthly to the National \n\nAntimicrobial Utilisation Surveillance Program (NAUSP). The NAUSP process analyses the data for each hospital and then issues a report that enable the institutions to benchmark their usage against similar comparator hospitals. This information provides great insights into patterns of use across Australia but is not optimal for targeting which \nunits with in the hospital are likely to benefit most from intervention. A project is currently underway at a Perth metropolitan hospital to bring the analysis of the data in-house. This has the advantage of not just being able to examine the information in more detail but it has been able to increase the number of antibiotics that are included, examine whether the agents are given intravenously or orally and include emergency department prescribing that is not included in the existing national program.",
    "description": "The goal of this challenge is to develop the data analytical tools to eliminate the current manually intensive process and produce smart reports of monthly antibiotic usage for feedback to the hospital clinical teams as well as create an interactive interface to enable dynamic queries. We intend this tool to help clinicians take greater ownership of the information about their prescribing practice with the aim of improving antibiotic use for better patient outcomes and reducing collateral effects from antibiotic misuse. If the project proves that this strategy is effective, it could be converted to a generic platform to be used more widely nationally and internationally.\n\nHospital monthly antimicrobial dispensing and hospital occupancy data is to be converted to the internationally recognised drug usage rate of defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 occupied bed days for analysis over time, by agent, route of administration and department. The output will be smart visually attractive reports and an interactive platform for analysis on demand.\n\nMethods\n\n- supply by tablet and dosage will be converted to supply in grams\n- the correct World Health Organisation defined daily dose (DDD) will be assigned to each agent\n- the standardised dose will by calculated by dividing the supplied grams by the DDD \n- the standardised dose will be divided by 1000 bed days to allow benchmarking of doses of agents used by department",
